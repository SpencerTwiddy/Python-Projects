Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?;;;This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.;;;The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name\\'s sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever.;;;When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.;;;Sing to the LORD, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day.;;;Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth! Serve the LORD with gladness! Come into his presence with singing! Know that the LORD, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture. Enter his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with praise! Give thanks to him; bless his name! For the LORD is good; his steadfast love endures forever, and his faithfulness to all generations.;;;How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word.;;;I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.;;;Great is our Lord, and abundant in power; his understanding is beyond measure.;;;Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.;;;Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce; then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.;;;You keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you, because he trusts in you.;;;but they who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.;;;fear not, for I am with you; be not dismayed, for I am your God; I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.;;;All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.;;;The steadfast love of the LORD never ceases; his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.;;;She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.;;;And he said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.;;;Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.;;;In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.;;;Pray then like this: “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.;;;But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. “Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.;;;Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few.;;;Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters.;;;Then Jesus told his disciples, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?;;;For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.;;;Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.;;;For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.;;;And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.;;;But concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard, keep awake. For you do not know when the time will come.;;;And he said to them, “Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation.;;;But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil.;;;And he said to all, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.;;;But he said, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!”;;;And he said to them, “Take care, and be on your guard against all covetousness, for one\\'s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.;;;One who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much, and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much.;;;No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.;;;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men.;;;But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,;;;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.;;;Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.;;;Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.;;;A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.;;;Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.;;; Whoever has my commandments and keeps them, he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him.;;;If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you.;;;If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.;;;Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.;;;but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.;;;But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.;;;And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.;;;So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man.;;;For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.;;;as it is written: “None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.”;;;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God;;;No unbelief made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.;;;Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.;;;but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.;;;Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned—;;;Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.;;;For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.;;;For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.;;;What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?;;;And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.;;;He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?;;;For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.;;;You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.;;;For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”;;;So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.;;;But the righteousness based on faith says, “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down);;;I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?;;;Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.;;;I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.;;;Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.;;;In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God. For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience—by word and deed,;;;for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such people.;;;so that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”;;;What I mean is that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.”;;;“For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But we have the mind of Christ.;;;and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”;;;“Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.;;;and all ate the same spiritual food,;;;Do not be deceived: “Bad company ruins good morals.”;;;Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.;;;For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus\\' sake.;;;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.;;;Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?;;;The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.;;;Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?—unless indeed you fail to meet the test!;;;I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.;;;But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.;;;Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.;;;And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up. So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.;;;In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,;;;For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.;;;Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.;;;Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.;;;Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children. And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints. ;;;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. “Honor your father and mother” (this is the first commandment with a promise), “that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.”;;;And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.;;;For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.;;;Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.;;;Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.;;;Do all things without grumbling or disputing, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,;;;But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,;;;Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice. Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.;;;I can do all things through him who strengthens me.;;;And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.;;;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.;;;Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.;;;Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.;;;For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,;;;But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.;;;Follow the pattern of the sound words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. By the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, guard the good deposit entrusted to you.;;;Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.;;;But God\\'s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.”;;;Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,;;;All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.;;;preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.;;;For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.;;;he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,;;;For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.;;;For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.;;;Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.;;;Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.;;;And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.;;;And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.;;;Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.;;;And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.;;;Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.;;;Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, “I will never leave you nor forsake you.”;;;Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.;;;Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.;;;Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.;;;But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.;;;If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person\\'s religion is worthless.;;;For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.;;;For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.;;;So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.;;;Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation—;;;Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.;;;For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit,;;;If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler. Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.;;;Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.” Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.;;;If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.;;;If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.;;;Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride of life—is not from the Father but is from the world.;;;Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you.;;;Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.;;;And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life.;;;Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.'.split(\";;;\")\n",
